TASK 1: Array Manipulation
This task involved the creation of a new JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js' and writing a function called 'proccessArray' that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is trippled.

TASK 2: String formatting
For this task, I added a function called 'formatArrayStrings' to the 'arrayManipulation.js' file. This function takes two arrays as an arguments; an array of strings and an array of numbers proccessed by the 'proccesArray' function. It modifies each string on its corresponding number, capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lower case if the number is odd.

TASK 3: User Profiles
In this task, I created a new file called 'useInfo.js' and wrote a function called 'createUserProfiles'. This function takes an array of names and array of modified names from Task 2. The function then returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name and a unique ID that increases automatically.

NOTE: 
To ensure each user profile gets a unique ID, I declared the 'id' variable outside the 'createUserProfiles' function and incremented it inside the function.
